        <h2 class=project-title>HEX GAMES</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            In the summer of 2020, I've teamed up with <b>Hex</b> and founded <b>Hex Games</b>. Together, we've embarked on a hyper-casual
            journey where I've worked as Lead Developer.
            <br>
            During this time, we've strived to create games with unique mechanics and rigid gameplay.
            <br>
            <br>
            We've shipped over 20 games to App Store.

                Even with the harsh limitations, requirements, and time pressure of the hyper-casual genre, our ambition
                was always to create games that we love and respect.
                <!--<br>
                Designing, understanding, and developing many different games was satisfactory and quite educational.-->

        <p class="project-description">
            Unlit is a project that I come back to regularly, and not release. It is created with very talented <b>Gökhan
            Çınar</b> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zeminyok/" target="_blank">link</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ground concept of Unlit is the product of meditation on the touch screen controls and how to overcome
            their inherent <i>suckiness</i>. This "control-centric" design philosophy created strict boundaries.

                Designated area at the lower half of the screen is reserved for controls.
                <br>
                • 9 pieces of the area corresponds to the 9 points on the game board which character snaps to.<br>
                • Player controls the character by moving their finger on the control area.<br>
                • Finger position (almost) instantly reflects to the character position while respecting the
                snapping.<br>
                <br>
                This direct projection of finger to character movement and instantaneous game feedback creates highly
                dynamic gameplay opportunities.

        <h2 class=project-title>PLANET RUNNERS</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            Mobile multiplayer racing game; which is heavily influenced by endless runner games, SpeedRunners and MOBAs.
            I co-created Planet Runners with <b>Burç Tuncer</b> <a href="http://burctuncer.info/" target="_blank">link</a>. Burç created all the visuals alongside with amazing
            soundtrack which you should definitely check out.
            <br>
            <br>
            We aimed to create this game with "ULTRA MEGA SIMPLE CONTROLS" nevertheless with a strong sense of control
            and
            fluidity.
            Heroes have different stats and various skills to overcome opponents.

            <p>
                Early in design, we decided not to use any directional input. Players need to use basic controls (jump,
                dash) at the right time to indirectly control characters.
                This required a lot of tuning and balancing, meanwhile having an online multiplayer layer was a
                challenge.
                <br>
                <br>
                The absence of directional input created quite interesting conditions. For example, creating cyclic
                levels. We tried to overcome this with arrow elements that change the direction of the character and
                correctly placed springs.

        <p class="project-description">
            Being one of my first released games as a developer, this project holds relevancy.
            In this game, player uses its two fingers to merge balls on the touch screen with a pinch gesture.
            <br>
            It was essential to catch a feeling of ease at the pinch gesture. While gameplay required some motor skills,
            keeping the interference of basic physical failures to minimum was a clear aim we chased as a team.
            In retrospect, I believe we successfully realized the potential of the defined scope.
